            "Mathematics becomes more meaningful when it is contextualized and linked to students’ experiences across disciplines. Furthermore, mathematics should be viewed as an integrated whole, rather than as the study of separate strands or units. Within a particular topic, students should see the connections between concrete, pictorial, and symbolic modes of representation. When mathematical ideas are connected to each other or to real-world phenomena, students begin to view mathematics as useful, relevant, and integrated."

        "Mental Mathematics and Estimation": [
            "Mental mathematics is a combination of strategies that enhances flexible thinking and number sense. Estimation is a strategy for determining approximate values or quantities, usually by referring to benchmarks or using referents, or for determining the reasonableness of calculated values. Estimation is often used to make mathematical judgments and to develop useful, efficient strategies for dealing with situations in daily life. Strategies in mental mathematics and estimation enable students to calculate mentally without the use of external aids. In the process, they improve their computational fluency— developing efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility."

When students encounter new situations and respond to questions of the type How would you . . . ? or How could you . . . ?, the problem-solving approach is being modelled. Problems are often open-ended, so students may arrive at multiple solutions in different and creative ways. Rich problems allow students in the class to demonstrate their knowledge, skill, or understanding at a level appropriate to them. Learning through problem solving should be the focus of mathematics at all grade levels and should be embedded throughout all topics. "

The thinking skills developed by a focus on reasoning can be used in life in a wide variety of contexts and disciplines."

It enables students to explore and create patterns, organize and display data, examine relationships, model situations, generate and test conjectures, solve problems, and reinforce the learning of basic facts. Technology can help to satisfy the curiosity of students and lead to rich mathematical discoveries at all grade levels. The use of technology can enhance, although it should not replace, conceptual understanding, procedural thinking, and problem solving."

These judgments include distinguishing fact from opinion and interpretation, evaluating information and ideas, identifying perspectives and bias, and considering the consequences of decisions and actions.
